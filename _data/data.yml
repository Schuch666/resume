    title: Atmospheric Scientist
    summary: |
      Atmospheric scientist specializing in air quality modeling and 
      computational tool development. I currently work as a Postdoctoral 
      Research Associate at Northeastern University with in air quality 
      model aplication, evaluation, and development. I bring a wealth of 
      experience in computational tool development and a deep interest in 
      topics such as atmospheric boundary layer dynamics, turbulence, 
      transport phenomena, and atmospheric chemistry. My goal is to 
      advance the understanding of the atmosphere through 
      pioneering research and innovative analytical approaches.
